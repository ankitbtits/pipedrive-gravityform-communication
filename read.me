# Gravity Form Pipedrive Sync – Overview & Functionality

## Introduction
The Gravity Form Pipedrive Sync plugin is designed to seamlessly connect Gravity Forms on your WordPress website with Pipedrive CRM. This plugin allows you to automatically transfer data from forms to Pipedrive, manage organizations and deals, and update Pipedrive records directly from WordPress.

This document explains how the plugin works in simple terms, ensuring ease of use for your team.

## Main Features & How It Works

### 1. Setting Up Sync Between Gravity Forms & Pipedrive
- On the main page of the plugin (accessible from the WordPress dashboard), click **"Gravity Form Pipedrive Sync."**
- To create a new sync, click on the **"Add New pgfc"** button, then select the Gravity Form you want to sync with Pipedrive.
- After selecting the form, on the bottom row:
  - The first select option contains the form fields of the selected form.
  - The next select option determines where the data should be sent (e.g., **Add Person, Add Organization**).
  - The next select option includes API attributes (e.g., **name, email, phone, etc.**).
- You can add multiple mappings using the **"Add Item/Service"** button.
- Click **Publish** to activate the sync.
- Once published, all active mappings are displayed at the bottom of the page, where they can be edited later if needed.

### 2. Managing Plugin Settings
- In the **Settings** tab, you can enter or update your Pipedrive API key.
- If new custom fields are added in Pipedrive, click **"Resync Fields"** to update the plugin and fetch the latest fields.
- A **General Info** section provides a quick overview of key functionalities.

### 3. Monitoring API Logs
- The **API Logs** tab tracks any errors or issues when sending data to Pipedrive.
- This helps in troubleshooting and ensuring smooth data transfer.

## Editing & Managing Pipedrive Data from WordPress

### 1. Managing Organizations
- On a user’s profile page in WordPress, scroll to the bottom to find the **"Manage Organizations"** button.
- View a list of all organizations associated with that person.
- Users can add or remove a person from an organization as needed.

### 2. Editing Pipedrive Fields
- Below the **Person ID**, you’ll find all Pipedrive fields for that person.
- These fields are grouped into tabs: **Person, Organization, and Deal**.
- Simply edit the information and click **"Update Profile"** to sync changes with Pipedrive.

### 3. Viewing Activities of Deals
- In the **Deals** tab, a **"Show Deals Activities"** button allows users to view deal-related activities.

## Managing Pipedrive Data from the Frontend
